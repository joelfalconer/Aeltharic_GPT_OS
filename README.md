## **Repository Overview**

### **1. Aeltharic_GPT_OS**
- **Purpose**: Core operational system for Aeltharic, containing foundational guides, workflows, and modular tools.
- **Key Directories**:
  - `/core`: Foundational files such as system instructions, mythos, and philosophy.
  - `/docs`: Documentation for collaborators, including roadmaps and contribution guides.
  - `/modules`: Modular tools for creative writing, emotional dynamics, language, and visual development.
  - `/testing`: Automated testing and validation workflows.
- **Primary Uses**:
  - Reference foundational documents like `system_instructions.md`.
  - Use modular tools for specialized tasks (e.g., generating myths or simulating linguistic drift).

### **2. Aeltharic_Language**
- **Purpose**: Development and management of the Aeltharic language.
- **Key Files**:
  - `lexicon_and_roots.md`: Vocabulary roots and derivations.
  - `language_rules.md`: Grammar, syntax, and phonological principles.
- **Primary Uses**:
  - Expand the lexicon using established morphological and phonological rules.
  - Align linguistic development with cultural narratives and mythology.

### **3. Aeltharic_Worldbuilding**
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive repository for mythology, cultures, timelines, and ecology.
- **Key Directories**:
  - `/cultures`: Details of cultural practices and societal structures.
  - `/timelines`: Historical events and epoch summaries.
  - `/flora` and `/fauna`: Descriptions of plants and creatures unique to Aeltharic.
- **Primary Uses**:

## **Navigation Best Practices**

### **1. Search Strategy**
Use specific keywords to narrow down relevant files or sections. For example:
- Searching "Velorath" in `/core/mythos_and_philosophy.md` for mythological references.
- Searching "vowel harmony" in `/modules/language_tools/phonology_toolkit.md` for linguistic details.

### **2. File Identification**
When locating files:
- Refer to the `/docs` directory for high-level guides and roadmaps.
- Use `/modules` for task-specific tools and workflows.
- Leverage `/testing` to validate outputs against established rules.

### **3. Modular Expansion**
When updating or creating content:
- Align additions with principles outlined in `/core/mythos_and_philosophy.md`.
- Expand language or lexicon entries based on `/modules/language_tools` rules.
- Develop cultural or mythological elements referencing `/cultures` or `/timelines` in **Aeltharic_Worldbuilding**.

## **Common Tasks and Actions**

### **1. Adding Myths or Rituals**
1. Check `/core/mythos_and_philosophy.md` for thematic alignment.
2. Use `/modules/creative_tools/myth_generator.md` for structured creation.
3. Update cultural connections in `/cultures` or `/timelines`.

### **2. Expanding the Lexicon**
1. Identify relevant roots in `lexicon_and_roots.md`.
2. Apply rules from `/modules/language_tools/morphology_builder.md`.
3. Validate phonological consistency using `/modules/language_tools/phonology_toolkit.md`.

### **3. Validating Outputs**
1. Use `/testing/automated_tests.md` for automated validation.
2. Review feedback processes in `/testing/user_feedback.md` for iterative improvement.

## **Collaboration and Contribution**

### **1. Guidelines**
- Follow `contributing.md` in `/docs` for submission protocols.
- Reference `/docs/roadmap.md` to align contributions with project goals.

### **2. Collaboration Tools**
- Leverage `/modules/emotional_dynamics` for relational or character-driven narratives.
- Use `/modules/visual_tools` for glyph or visual design integration.

## **Tips for Efficient Navigation**
- Start with `/docs/readme.md` for an overview.
- Use `/core/system_instructions.md` to understand operational guidelines.
- Prioritize modular tools in `/modules` for specific creative or validation tasks.

This guide ensures consistent and efficient navigation of the Aeltharic repositories, streamlining contributions and development.
