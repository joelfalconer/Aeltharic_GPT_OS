# **Glyph Library for Aeltharic GPT OS**

## **Purpose**
This document curates a library of canonical glyphs used within the Aeltharic conlang and worldbuilding framework. Each glyph represents a specific linguistic, cultural, or mythological concept and aligns with the symbolic principles and phonotactic rules of Aeltharic.

- **Meaning**:
  - **Literal**: Knowledge rooted in nature.
  - **Symbolic**: Intuition, growth, and ancient understanding.
- **Design Notes**:
  - Tree-like vertical strokes branching into detailed leaf-like accents.

## **2. Guidelines for Glyph Creation**

### **2.1 Phonological Alignment**
- Ensure that the visual structure of the glyph corresponds to its phonological components.
- Example: Rounded shapes for vowels; angular strokes for consonants.

### **2.2 Symbolic Consistency**
- Glyphs must reflect the dualistic nature of Aeltharic culture, such as light/shadow, chaos/order.
- Incorporate mythological elements where relevant.

### **2.3 Aesthetic Harmony**
- Balance complexity and clarity to ensure glyphs are visually cohesive and culturally resonant.
- Use a consistent line weight and spacing.

## **3. Using Glyphs in Worldbuilding**

### **3.1 Integration in Texts**
- Use glyphs as ornamental elements in ceremonial scripts, adding authenticity and cultural depth.
- Align glyphs with corresponding Aeltharic text to enhance thematic resonance.

### **3.2 Application in Artifacts**
- Inscribe glyphs on tools, weapons, and ceremonial items to represent their purpose and power.
- Example: Velisdrithar glyph on protective amulets.

### **3.3 Adaptations Across Dialects**
- Allow minor variations in glyphs to reflect regional dialects or cultural nuances.
- Document all adaptations in the `regional_variations.md` file for consistency.

## **4. Extending the Glyph Library**

### **4.1 Contribution Workflow**
1. Use the `glyph_generator.md` module to create new glyphs.
2. Validate phonological and symbolic accuracy using `automated_tests.md`.
3. Submit new glyph designs for review through the `user_feedback.md` process.

### **4.2 Canonization Process**
- Approved glyphs are added to this library with detailed annotations.
- Update linked modules (e.g., `symbolic_alignment.md`) to ensure consistency.

This library will evolve as new glyphs are created and integrated into the Aeltharic GPT OS. Contributors are encouraged to maintain the symbolic and linguistic integrity of the conlang when designing and implementing glyphs.
