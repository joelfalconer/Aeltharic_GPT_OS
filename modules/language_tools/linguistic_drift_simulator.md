# **Linguistic Drift Simulator**

## **Purpose**
The `linguistic_drift_simulator.md` provides tools and methodologies for simulating phonological and grammatical changes over time or across dialects in the Aeltharic conlang. This module enables users to model linguistic evolution, creating realistic scenarios for language divergence and cultural shifts.

## **1. Phonological Drift**

### **1.1 Algorithms for Phonological Changes**
- **Sound Shifts**: Define transformations of phonemes over time (e.g., /t/ > /s/ in certain dialects).
- **Vowel Harmony**: Simulate gradual adoption of harmonic patterns in regional dialects.
- **Consonant Cluster Simplification**: Model the reduction of complex clusters (e.g., /str/ > /st/).
- **Stress and Tone**:
  - Shift primary stress patterns (e.g., from the first syllable to the penultimate syllable).
  - Simulate tonal development in specific dialects.

### **1.2 Parameters for Drift Simulation**
- **Geographical Factors**: Define how isolation or proximity influences sound changes.
- **Cultural Influences**: Incorporate borrowings or shifts due to interaction with neighboring languages.
- **Temporal Granularity**: Adjust how quickly changes occur (e.g., per generation or century).

## **2. Morphological Evolution**

### **2.1 Simplifications and Complexities**
- **Loss of Inflection**: Model the gradual reduction of case endings or verb conjugations.
- **New Affixes**: Simulate the emergence of prefixes, suffixes, or infixes derived from older forms.
- **Analytic vs. Synthetic Trends**:
  - Movement toward more analytic constructions (e.g., reliance on helper verbs).
  - Development of synthetic forms through compounding.

### **2.2 Interactive Tools**
- **Affix Tracker**: Visualize how specific affixes evolve or disappear over time.
- **Root Divergence Map**: Generate mappings of how roots split or merge across dialects.

## **3. Grammatical Shifts**

### **3.1 Syntax Divergence**
- Simulate shifts in word order (e.g., from SOV to SVO).
- Track changes in clause structure and subordinate constructions.

### **3.2 Agreement Systems**
- Model how agreement rules for gender, number, and case evolve.
- Explore scenarios of agreement loss or gain.

### **3.3 Auxiliary Verbs**
- Simulate the development of auxiliary verbs to express tense, mood, or aspect.
- Model their integration into existing grammatical systems.

## **4. Divergence Scenarios for Dialects**

### **4.1 Regional Variations**
- **Isolated Communities**: Simulate how geographical isolation fosters distinct phonological traits.
- **Trade Hubs**: Model linguistic blending in areas of heavy interaction.

### **4.2 Sociolects and Registers**
- Track how class, profession, or social context influences language change.
- Simulate shifts in formal vs. informal speech patterns.

### **4.3 Interaction with Other Languages**
- Borrowing Rates: Define the rate at which words, phrases, or grammatical structures are adopted.
- Code-Switching: Model transitional periods of bilingual or multilingual usage.

## **5. Output and Analysis Tools**

### **5.1 Change Logs**
- Generate step-by-step logs of phonological, morphological, and grammatical changes.

### **5.2 Comparative Tables**
- Visualize differences between base language and derived dialects.
- Include IPA representations, glosses, and syntactic notes.

### **5.3 Dialect Maps**
- Create visual representations of linguistic diversity across regions.
- Annotate maps with key phonological and grammatical changes.

---

## **6. Best Practices**
- Start with a clear base set of phonological, morphological, and syntactic rules from `language_rules.md`.
- Incorporate cultural and historical contexts to anchor linguistic evolution.
- Use iterative feedback to refine simulations, referencing `user_feedback.md`.
