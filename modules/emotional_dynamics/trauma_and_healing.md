## **1. Core Themes of Trauma and Healing**

### **1.1 Duality of Loss and Renewal**
1. **Drithvelarionis** (Shadow-Light Interplay):
   - Trauma is often depicted as a shadow (_Drith_) obscuring light (_Velar_), with healing symbolized by their interplay and eventual balance.
   - Example Phrase: _Drith moravel en velar thyra._
     - Translation: Shadow flows through fragile truth to light.

2. **Cycles of Destruction and Rebirth**:
   - Trauma initiates a cycle of transformation, leading to renewal and self-discovery.
   - Example Archetype: _Thalasdrithar_ (Truth-Shadow Bringer).

3. **Fractured Harmony**:
   - Depicts the disruption of balance and the journey toward restoration.
   - Cultural Representation: Ceremonial songs recounting the loss of _Thyrmoros_ (Gate of Unity).
