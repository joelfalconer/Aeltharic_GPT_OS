# **Collaborator Guide for Aeltharic GPT OS**

## **Purpose**
This guide provides contributors with comprehensive guidelines for developing modules, maintaining documentation, and ensuring consistency across the Aeltharic GPT OS. By adhering to these standards, contributors can seamlessly integrate their work into the system and contribute to its growth.

## **1. Workflow for Module Development**

### **1.1 Development Stages**
1. **Planning**:
   - Define the module's purpose and scope.
   - Identify dependencies and cross-module interactions.
   - Draft an outline for the module's content and functionality.

2. **Implementation**:
   - Write the module content in Markdown format.
   - Ensure compliance with the standards outlined in `system_instructions.md`.
   - Include structured headings, clear descriptions, and actionable instructions.

3. **Testing**:
   - Run automated tests outlined in `automated_tests.md` to validate functionality.
   - Cross-check outputs for phonological, grammatical, and thematic consistency.

4. **Review and Refinement**:
   - Submit the module for peer review.
   - Address feedback documented in `user_feedback_aggregator.md`.

5. **Integration**:
   - Update relevant cross-references in core files (e.g., `readme.md`, `roadmap.md`).
   - Include the module in the appropriate directory structure.

## **2. Coding and Documentation Standards**

### **2.1 Markdown Standards**
- Use consistent heading hierarchy (e.g., `#`, `##`, `###`) for clarity.
- Ensure lists, tables, and code blocks follow proper syntax.
- Include inline comments for complex sections to aid understanding.

### **2.2 Formatting Guidelines**
- **Modules**: Begin with a clear purpose statement and structured sections.
- **Examples**: Provide examples for every major feature or function.
- **References**: Link to related modules and core files.

### **2.3 Naming Conventions**
- Use descriptive and consistent filenames (e.g., `phonology_toolkit.md`, `myth_generator.md`).
- Avoid special characters or spaces in file names.

---

## **3. Guidelines for Integration**

### **3.1 Dependency Management**
- Clearly document dependencies in the module header.
- Use cross-links to reference relevant modules (e.g., `lexicon_expander.md`, `language_rules.md`).

### **3.2 Version Control**
- Use Git for tracking changes.
- Include a changelog entry for significant updates.
- Ensure commits are clear and descriptive (e.g., `Added declension rules to morphology_builder.md`).

### **3.3 Testing Requirements**
- Validate content using test cases in `content_validator.md`.
- Ensure outputs align with linguistic, cultural, and thematic standards.

---

## **4. Collaboration Best Practices**

### **4.1 Communication**
- Use designated collaboration tools (e.g., Slack, Discord) for discussions.
- Document major decisions in a shared repository.

### **4.2 Peer Review**
- Conduct thorough reviews before integration.
- Use the templates in `user_feedback_aggregator.md` for structured feedback.

### **4.3 Continuous Improvement**
- Regularly review existing modules for updates or refinements.
- Participate in scheduled brainstorming sessions for new features.

## **5. Key Resources**
- **Core Files**: `system_instructions.md`, `language_rules.md`, `mythos_and_philosophy.md`
- **Testing Tools**: `automated_tests.md`, `content_validator.md`
- **Feedback Tools**: `user_feedback_aggregator.md`
- **Version Control**: Git repository for tracking changes and managing contributions.
