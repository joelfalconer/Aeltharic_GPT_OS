# **Aeltharic GPT OS - README**

## **Overview**
The **Aeltharic GPT OS** is a modular system designed to generate, manage, and refine content based on the rich linguistic, philosophical, and cultural world of Aeltharic. This OS is a comprehensive toolkit for creating immersive narratives, conlang components, visual glyphs, and relational dynamics, all rooted in the unique mythological and linguistic constructs of Aeltharic.

---

## **Purpose**
The purpose of the Aeltharic GPT OS is to:
- Enable seamless generation of Aeltharic-based creative works.
- Support worldbuilders, writers, and designers with tools adhering to Aeltharic language and cultural rules.
- Promote modular and scalable workflows for collaborative development.
